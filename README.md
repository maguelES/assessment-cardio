# Assessment Project - Cardio Challenges API

It's a RESTful API project, helps to list the available Cardio Challenges. Created using Spring
Boot Framework (starter).

## Introduction
Initially created as an assessment for a local company in Malaysia, I've since decided to make it available
on Github. Feel free to clone or fork it for personal or commercial purposes.

## Installation

Use the provided Maven Wrapper to run the project. 

Alternatively, just use your favourite IDE to help you. I used [STS](https://spring.io/tools), an Eclipse-based IDE.

```bash
